Bitscale Smart Contracts
========================

Welcome to the Bitscale Smart Contracts repository! This repository contains smart contracts written in Solidity for the Bitscale platform. These contracts enable various functionalities and interactions within the Bitscale ecosystem.

Overview
--------

Bitscale is an Operating-System-Level Bitcoin scaling solution focused on Finance. It enables smart contracts to use Bitcoin as a utility asset trustlessly by implementing Double-Way-Pegging architecture, cutting-edge Zero-knowledge technology, and an OS account system.

Smart Contracts
---------------

This repository hosts various smart contracts that form the backbone of the Bitscale platform. Here are some key contracts included:

-   **Double-Way-Pegging Contract:** Implements the Double-Way-Pegging mechanism for trustlessly using Bitcoin as a utility asset in smart contracts.
-   **Token Contracts:** Manages tokens within the Bitscale ecosystem, allowing for the creation and transfer of tokens.
-   **Escrow Contracts:** Facilitates secure and trustless escrow services for transactions within the Bitscale ecosystem.
-   **Oracle Contracts:** Provides external data feeds to smart contracts for making informed decisions.
-   **Governance Contracts:** Implements governance mechanisms for decentralized decision-making within the Bitscale ecosystem.
